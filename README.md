## Little Lemon Restaurant Backend API

A fully functioning backend API for managing a restaurant system, including menu items, orders, and user roles (Manager, Delivery crew, and Customers). This API allows role-based access to ensure only authorized users can perform certain actions, like assigning delivery crew to orders or placing orders.

### Features

    - Role-based access control: Manager, Delivery crew, and Customer roles with different access levels.

    - Menu management: View and update menu items.

    - Order management: Customers can create orders, managers can assign delivery crew, and delivery crew can update order status.

    - JWT Authentication: Secure API endpoints using Djoser for authentication and role management.

    - Filtering and Pagination: Efficient data retrieval with filtering and pagination features.

    - Deployed on AWS EC2: The API is hosted on an AWS EC2 instance with Nginx and Gunicorn for production readiness.
